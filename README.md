# Akr-Blockchain
When I wrote this code, only god and I knew how it worked.
Now, only god knows it.    

In all seriousnes, this was the hardest task in AKR yet. As a person with zero knowledge with Python, they expected me to code something like this from a scrath with scuffed tutorial and no help from teacher whatsoever. This was my first time ever seeing Python, but I don't think the code is that bad.
